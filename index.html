      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Kherin Trufina, a passionate law student currently pursuing my B.com., LL.B at SASTRA University (2023–2028). Born and raised in Karumandapam, Trichy, I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity for justice, truth, and the workings of the legal system — especially criminal law, which I aim to specialize in.</p>
      <p>I come from a humble and hardworking family. My father, Arockiaraj, is a tea stall owner and real estate businessman whose dedication has been a constant source of inspiration. From my early school days to entering the field of law, my journey has been rooted in discipline, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to growth.</p>
      <p>I believe every voice deserves to be heard and every story understood. My goal is to use the law not just as a career, but as a tool for empowerment and justice.</p>
